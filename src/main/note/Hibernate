//example
in Employee class has
@OneToMany(mappedBy="employee",
			cascade= {CascadeType.DETACH, CascadeType.MERGE,CascadeType.PERSIST,CascadeType.REFRESH})
	private List<Item> items;

in Item class has
@JoinTable(
			name="assets",
			joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="item_id", insertable=false, updatable=false),
			inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="emp_id", insertable=false, updatable=false)	
			)
	private Employee employee;

-OneToMany -One Employee Many Items.
-Where mappedby is implemented then that class is not in the "Own" side
-class that has the joinTable is the "Own" side of the association
-Exclude cascadeType.Delete because we dont want to delete the item if we delete the employee.
